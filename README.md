This repository represents all the work I have done during the august pool of 1337.

## What is 1337?

1337 is an IT Programming School in Morroco that Follows a Project-Based Learning Pedagogy as well
as a Peer-Learning Pedagogy. This means you learn Software Engineering with Projects, with writing 
programs and debugging them, not much theory but very much practice.

The Interesting part of this is that there are no Professors there, just you and your Mac Desk in addition 
to your Peers who are going to help you if have ever needed some help in a project.
